# YuneecGoogleEarth
Yuneec Google Earth will decode the Yuneec message protocol and create KML files for Google Earth to read at 1Hz.

This application is used after the Yuneec protocol has been decoded using the SnagABee application. The Texas Instrument Zigbee Sniffer application must be running and broadcasting UDP messages for this to work.

The Texas Instrument application can be downloaded here:
